# LEGO-Investing-Portfolio-Manager
A python web scraping application that will keep the values and other details of your LEGO investments up to date with brickeconomy.com. I am building this application for my own personal use but would love for it to become a useful tool for the LEGO investing community. Suggestions are encouraged!

# The Problem
You've invested in LEGO products but costantly have to check online for the current values of each of your sets.

# The Solution
Automate this process with python! This application will pull use data from brickeconomy.com to keep the current value of your investments up to date so you only have to check one place to evaluate your current position. Simply fill out the 'Set #', 'Purchase Price', 'Quantity', and any additional columns you wish in the file 'Brickfolio.csv' and this program will fill in the 'Retail Value' and 'Current Value' columns whenever it is executed.

Brickeconomy does offer similar information to their users but I want to have more control over what data I can see and in what format.

# Usage Instructions (After cloning the repository)
You can run the script from your machine's terminal or command line by running the following command after navigating into the folder of the cloned project:

python main.py

# Future Work
As of 7/28/2021 this project is actively being worked on and improved. The project is in its very early stages and there are plenty of planned featrures including the abilities to add sets by filling out prompts, sort sets by value, display your current ROI, and more. Suggestions are encouraged!
